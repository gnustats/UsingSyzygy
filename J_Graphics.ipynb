    "The basic idea is to create a Scalable Vector Graphics file (of type .svg) and fill is with text commands that indicate what to draw for the graphics image. You can read more details of all that can be draw here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: images displayed are often \"cached\" by your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc), which means the file is pre-loaded for convenience. However, if your Jupyter code changes the .svg file, the browser does not know to re-draw the new image. One way to force it to draw the new image is to re-load the page. (Remember to save first.)\n",

    "In this example, we will simply draw a couple of lines. The file will have four entries of simple text. The first entry marks the  file as an svg file, the last entry indicates the end of the svg file. Two entries in the middle draw two lines. The text will look like this: \n",

    "$$h = u + u^* + v + v^*.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The curious thing is that the spectrum of $h$ is either a union of intervals, or a Cantor set, depending on whether $\\theta$ is rational or irrational. Which seems odd in physics, that a tiny perturbation in one parameter should give such a fundamental change in the nature of the spectra. \n",

Setting $z_1 = z_2 = 1$ gives one extreme set of spectral points, that form one-half of the interval endpoints that make up the spectrum. Setting $z_1 = z_2 = e^{2\\pi i/q}$ gives the other extreme set, forming the other set of endpoints. \n",
